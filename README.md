# Recommender System

This is the second big project that I've worked on during the course of learning ML.

Dataset used is MovieLens 100K latest. I've only used the part of the data which has the rating in it as my intention was to build a pure collaborative filtering recommendation engine. I haven't used any content based data because it would've hampered my intention of doing this project. If you're wondering, content based data would furthur enhance my recommender system and it's done using a mixture of collaborative filtering and content based information in the real world.

In this project I've built three models for recommending movies 
1. Regression Model
2. User-user similarity model
3. Matrix factorization model

**METRIC USED: RMSE and MAE**

## Regression Model
In the Regression based model I've blindly made a regressor just to set a benchmark of the performace.
